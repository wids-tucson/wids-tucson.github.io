### Ashley Huggins

##### Mapping the brain in PTSD: leveraging global, large-scale neuroimaging datasets to identify structural and functional neural markers of posttraumatic stress disorder

Dr. Ashley Huggins is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Psychology at the University of Arizona, where she directs the Cognition, Affect, and Traumatic Stress (CATS) Lab. She earned her PhD in Clinical Psychology from the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee. Dr. Huggins is an affective neuroscientist and clinical neuropsychologist whose research focuses on better understand brain-based mechanisms involved in the onset and development of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).
