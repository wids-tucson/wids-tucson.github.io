The WIDS Tucson Data Blitz sessions will be *short* (3-minute) talks from members of the WIDS community. A slide template will be provided - you just need to tell us about your exciting work!

We will have a morning session and, if needed, an additional afternoon session. Within each session, attendees will vote on their favorite talks. This will be a low-stakes opportunity to get recognition for your presentations!
