## Leveraging Artificial Intelligence and Big Data to create Value

The phenomenal growth of social media, mobile applications, sensor based technologies and the Internet of Things is generating a flood of "Big Data" and disrupting our world in many ways. Simultaneously, we are seeing many interesting developments in
machine learning and Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies and methods. In this talk I will examine the paradigm shift caused by recent developments in AI and Big Data and ways to harness their power to create a smarter world. Using examples from
health care, smart cities, education, and businesses in general, I will highlight challenges and research opportunities for developing organizations of the future.
