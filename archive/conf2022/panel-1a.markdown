      Karina Salazar is an assistant professor in the Center for the Study of Higher Education. Her research program analyzes whether the enrollment management practices of public universities undermine access for underserved student populations, with a particular focus on recruiting and marketing. Using “data science” methodologies and FOIA requests as data collection strategies, her current work explores how university recruiting and marketing efforts spatially discriminate against high schools and communities with predominantly low-income students and Students of Color. 
      Salazar’s research has been published in The American Educational Research Journal, The Journal of Higher Education, and Research in Higher Education.  She is also co-principal investigator of the Enrollment Management, Recruiting, and Access research project, which has been featured by The New York Times, NPR, CNN, Inside Higher Ed, The Chronicle of Higher Education, Forbes, and U.S. News & World Report. Salazar is a local Tucsonan and proud graduate of Sunnyside High School. She completed her graduate work at the University of Arizona where her dissertation research was funded by the American Educational Research Association. </td>
