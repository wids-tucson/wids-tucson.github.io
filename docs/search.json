    "text": "WiDS Tucson Meetings are an interactive environment for listening and considering new ideas from a diverse group, with respect for all participants without regard to gender, gender identity or expression, race, color, national or ethnic origin, religion or religious belief, age, marital status, sexual orientation, disabilities, veteran status, or any other aspect of how we identify ourselves. It is the policy of the WIDS Meeting that all participants will enjoy an environment free from all forms of discrimination, harassment, and retaliation.\nConsequently, individuals must use discretion to ensure that their words and actions communicate respect for others. This is especially important for those in positions of authority since individuals with lower rank or status may be reluctant to express their objections or discomfort regarding unwelcome behavior.\nSexual harassment does not refer to occasional compliments of a socially acceptable nature. It refers to behavior that is not welcome, is personally offensive, debilitates morale, and therefore, interferes with work effectiveness.\nThe following are examples of behavior that, when unwelcome, may constitute sexual harassment: sexual flirtations, advances, or propositions; verbal comments or physical actions of a sexual nature; sexually degrading words used to describe an individual; a display of sexually suggestive objects or pictures; sexually explicit jokes; unnecessary touching.\nHarassment on the basis of any other protected characteristic is also strictly prohibited. This conduct includes, but is not limited to the following: epithets, slurs, or negative stereotyping; threatening, intimidating, or hostile acts; denigrating jokes and display or circulation of written or graphic material that denigrates or shows hostility or aversion toward an individual or group.\nDiscrimination refers to bias or prejudice resulting in denial of opportunity, or unfair treatment regarding selection, promotion, or transfer. Discrimination is practiced commonly on the grounds of age, disability, ethnicity, origin, political belief, race, religion, sex, etc. factors which are irrelevant to a person‚Äôs competence or suitability.\nRetaliation refers to taking some action to negatively impact another based on them reporting an act of discrimination or harassment."

    "text": "The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has placed epidemic modeling at the forefront of public policymaking. Predicting the severity and speed of transmission of COVID-19 is crucial to resource management and developing strategies to deal with this epidemic. Despite the usefulness, modeling and forecasting the spread of COVID-19 remains a challenge. In this talk, we selectively review models for epidemic forecasting, especially in COVID-19 projection, and illustrate how these models could be connected to each other. We lay out the challenges of COVID-19 forecasting from data collection, curation, and validation to the limitations of models as well as the uncertainty of the forecast. Finally, we discuss some data science practices that are crucial to more robust and accurate epidemic forecasting.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDr.¬†Lily Wang\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProfessorDepartment of StatisticsIowa State University\n\n\n  @LilyWan84496995\n\n\n\n\n Linkedin\n\n\n\n\n Website\n\n\n\n\nDr.¬†Lily Wang is a tenured Professor of Statistics at Iowa State University.

    "section": "",
    "text": "Alzheimer‚Äôs disease (AD) and Parkinson‚Äôs disease (PD) are the 2 most common neurodegenerative diseases worldwide. In recent years, a non-invasive brain stimulation approach, called ‚Äútranscranial magnetic stimulation or TMS‚Äù, has been closely investigated to evaluate its potential to improve clinical symptoms of AD and PD. Accumulating studies investigating the effectiveness of TMS have yielded mixed results, possibly due to low statistical power and wide variation in treatment protocols. In this talk, I will show how we can integrate these findings with meta-analytic approach to account for methodological heterogeneity and more accurately estimate the therapeutic effects of TMS in AD and PD.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDr.¬†Ying-hui Chou\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAssistant Professor Director, Brain Imaging and TMS Laboratory Department of Psychology University of Arizona\n\n\n @BrainTms\n\n\n\n\n Website\n\n\n\n\nDr.¬†Ying-hui Chou is the director of the Brain Imaging and Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) Laboratory at the University of Arizona.

    "text": "Response process data collected from human-computer interactive items contain rich information about respondents‚Äô behavioral patterns and cognitive processes. Their irregular formats as well as their large sizes make standard statistical tools difficult to apply. This paper develops a computationally efficient method for exploratory analysis of such process data. The new approach segments a lengthy individual process into a sequence of short subprocesses to achieve complexity reduction, easy clustering and meaningful interpretation. Each subprocess is considered a subtask.\nThe segmentation is based on sequential action predictability using a parsimonious predictive model combined with the Shannon entropy. Simulation studies are conducted to assess performance of the new methods. We use the case study of PIAAC 2012 to demonstrate how exploratory analysis for process data can be done with the new approach.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDr.¬†Xueying Tang\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAssistant Professor Department of Mathematics University of Arizona\n\n\n Linkedin\n\n\n\n\n Website\n\n\n\n\nI got my PhD in Statistics from the University of Florida.

    "section": "",
    "text": "Seemingly neutral academic policies can have major consequences for student success. When institutional research revealed that the existing academic eligibility policy was having an outsized and negative impact on the persistence of first-generation and minoritized first-time students, The University of Arizona decided to introduce a warning semester. Rather than placing students directly onto academic probation, we sought to offer a clearer, more intentional policy and to use the warning semester as an opportunity to connect students with supports and resources to help them thrive in college. Also, by adopting principles of regression discontinuity designs‚Äîwhich are ideally suited to observing the impact of policies featuring a cutoff‚Äîwe estimated that introducing a warning semester could lift retention among first-time students by as much as two percentage points. Indeed, we observed a one percentage point gain in retention among the first cohort of students under the new policy. This talk will focus on leveraging institutional data for coalition building in support of equity and policy change.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDr.¬†Sarah Kyte\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSenior Research Scientist Student Success & Retention Innovation University of Arizona\n\n Linkedin  Website\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSarah Kyte, PhD, is leading a responsive, action-driven, and rigorous portfolio of research and partnerships focused on supporting student success.

    "section": "",
    "text": "Floods affect more people than any other hazard, and the frequency and magnitude of exposure is growing with demographic and climatic changes. Yet the ability to predict and monitor floods from local to global scales remains a challenge and limits access to financial protection for vulnerable populations. The increasing availability, frequency, and spatio-temporal resolution of satellite data provides new opportunities to monitor floods locally and globally. Advances in cloud computing and machine learning techniques enable increasingly accurate flood event monitoring by fusing observations from multiple sensors. I will show how new methods and data enabled by machine learning, and satellites improve our ability to understand and adapt to flood risk from global to local scales. This talk will demonstrate how improved flood observations yield insight into where populations are moving into flood plains, inform decisions to relocate refugee camps, underpin innovative insurance schemes in Bangladesh, and monitor Monsoon floods right here in Pima County!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDr.¬†Beth Tellman\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAssistant Professor School of Geography, Development & Environment Affiliate faculty, Hydrology & Atmostpheric Sciences  Affiliate faculty, Latin American Studies University of Arizona\n\n Website\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDr.¬†Beth Tellman is a human-environment geographer whose research addresses the causes and consequences of global environmental change on people, focusing on access to water, flood risk, and land-use change.

    "title": "1:25pm Room B - Simultaneously Understanding Individual Connection and Neural Network Differences Between Groups: Simulation Pipeline and Algorithm Development",
    "section": "",
    "text": "A challenge in studies of neural network connectivity differences between two populations is to understand simultaneously both individual connectivity differences and larger-scale network connectivity differences. Because of the nature of neuroimaging data, such investigations can suffer from a massive multiple comparisons problem. Even parcelling the brain into a series of regions of interest and examining connectivity between regions can quickly result in tens of thousands of tests. The network-based statistic (NBS) method (Zalesky et al.¬†2010) was developed to capitalize on network connectivity information to determine statistical significance but at the cost of understanding differences in individual connections. A variation on this ‚Äî threshold-free NBS (Baggio et al.¬†2017) ‚Äî was developed to leverage group connectivity while still allowing inference on individual connections. This method, however, loses the relationships between connections that result from an NBS analysis. The current work-in-progress aims to develop an analysis that reinstates the network information lost in threshold-free NBS. As part of this work, I have developed a method for simulating resting-state fMRI data for two groups of subjects with specific connectivity differences between the groups. Such simulations are helpful in better understanding the method and its performance in a range of scenarios. In this talk, I will discuss the simulation approach and the current stage of analysis development.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDr.¬†Julia Fisher\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAssistant Research Professor Statistics Consulting Laboratory (StatLab) University of Arizona\n\n Website\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDr.¬†Fisher received her M.S. in statistics and her Ph.D.¬†in linguistics from the University of Arizona. Subsequently, she spent a couple years working as a staff statistician in the Statistics Consulting Laboratory before transitioning to her current position as an assistant research professor in the BIO5 Institute. Her dissertation work focused on understanding the neural processing of speech sounds. Her current work combines her backgrounds in both neuroimaging and statistics and centers on a) understanding the parameters of existing statistical methods for imaging data and b) developing new methods. She lives in Tucson with her husband, daughter, and three ridiculous cats. She loves beautifully-illustrated science literature for children, handstands, and gardening."

    "text": "After over 50 years in use, adverse drug events due to warfarin therapy remain a major clinical concern, with approximately 10% of users reporting adverse events. Weekly therapeutic doses of warfarin vary up to 15- fold among individuals, making it difficult to predict a patient‚Äôs therapeutic dose which may increase the number of adverse drug events seen in warfarin therapy. The field of precision medicine aims to accurately predict which therapy best fits a patient and their perfect dosing schedule to achieve the safest, most effective pharmaceutical therapy. For example, genetic and non-genetic factors are used to predict dose in algorithms that aim to alleviate adverse drug events. Recently, microbiomes of the human body have been established as additional drivers of drug response variability. Between the human genome, host microbiomes, and clinical data scraped from electronic health records, precision medicine has a surplus of data!

    "section": "",
    "text": "Historical and long-term environmental datasets are imperative to understanding how natural systems respond to our changing world. Although immensely valuable, these data are at risk of being lost unless actively curated and archived on data repositories. The practice of data rescue, which we define as identifying, preserving, and sharing valuable data and associated metadata at risk of loss, is an important means of ensuring the long-term viability and accessibility of such datasets. Improvements in policies and best practices around data management will hopefully limit future need for data rescue; these changes, however, do not apply retroactively. While rescuing data is not new, the term lacks formal definition, is often conflated with other terms (i.e., data reuse), and lacks general recommendations. Here, we outline seven key guidelines for effective rescue of historically-collected and unmanaged datasets. We discuss prioritization of datasets to rescue, forming effective data rescue teams, preparing the data and related metadata, and archiving and sharing the rescued data. In an era of rapid environmental change, the best policy solutions will require evidence from both contemporary and historical sources. It is, therefore, imperative that we identify and preserve valuable, at-risk environmental data before they are lost to science.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDr.¬†Ellen Bledsoe\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAssistant Professor of Practice in Data Science School of Natural Resources and Environment University of Arizona\n\n Website   @bleds22e\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEllen Bledsoe is an Assistant Professor of Practice in Data Science in Univ.

Existing principles within the open data movement (e.g.¬†FAIR: findable, accessible, interoperable, reusable) primarily focus on characteristics of data that will facilitate increased data sharing among entities while ignoring power differentials and historical contexts. The emphasis on greater data sharing alone creates a tension for Indigenous Peoples who are also asserting greater control over the application and use of Indigenous data and Indigenous Knowledge for collective benefit.\nThis includes the right to create value from Indigenous data in ways that are grounded in Indigenous worldviews and realize opportunities within the knowledge economy. The CARE Principles for Indigenous Data Governance (eg: for the collective benefit, with the authority to control, carrying responsibility and ethics) are people and purpose-oriented, reflecting the crucial role of data in advancing Indigenous innovation and self-determination. These principles complement the existing FAIR principles encouraging open and other data movements to consider both people and purpose in their advocacy and pursuits.

    "section": "",
    "text": "My research is focused on improved understanding of the dynamics of large scale hydrologic systems. In the last five years, high-resolution physically based groundwater surface water simulations have become feasible at the national scale due to computational and modeling advances. These large scale simulations have facilitated novel quantifications of groundwater surface water interactions as well as the contribution of lateral groundwater flow to watershed systems. However, the application of these large modeling platforms outside of the scientific development community remains limited by significant technical barriers to entry. Simulations of this sort require both hydrologic expertise to build and design, but also applied math, data science and computer science to maintain computational efficiency, leverage high performance computing resources, and manage large model output datasets. In this talk I will discuss the integral role of data science in building better models, creating reproducible research and ultimately learning more from our studies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDr.¬†Laura Condon\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAssistant ProfessorDepartment of Hydrology and Atmospheric SciencesUniversity of Arizona\n\n\n\n @LCofthedesert\n\n\n\n\n Linkedin\n\n\n\n\n Website\n\n\n\n\nDr.¬†Condon studies water sustainability and the dynamics of hydrologic systems. Her work combines physically based numerical modeling with statistical techniques to evaluate complex system behavior. She received her graduate degrees from the Colorado School of Mines.

For example, in one of my group‚Äôs recordings, a speaker pronounced ‚Äúgonna hafta‚Äù with just two syllables (sort of ‚Äù got.tuh‚Äù), and in another, a different speaker pronounced ‚Äúdo you have time‚Äù as two syllables with no trace of the word ‚Äúhave‚Äù at all. Another speaker pronounced ‚ÄúFriday night‚Äù as one syllable, something like ‚Äúfreh‚Ä¶‚Äù stretched out in time. And yet these fast, ‚Äúsloppy‚Äù pronunciations sound fine if you hear them in context, and are not hard to understand if you‚Äôre hearing your native language. What‚Äôs amazing is that this is actually how we communicate information.  I also work with the Mutsun community of California, a Native American community from near San Juan Bautista CA, to try to help them learn their heritage language (Mutsun) and teach it in their community. The last person who learned Mutsun fluently as a child passed away in 1930, but there are a lot of written records of the language\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDr.¬†Sonja Lanehart\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProfessor Department of Linguistics Teaching, Learning, and Sociocultural Studies Faculty Fellow, Graduate College  University of Arizona\n\n\n  @sonjalanehart\n\n\n\n\n Linkedin\n\n\n\n\n Website\n\n\n\n\nSonja Lanehart is Professor of Linguistics, Teaching, Learning, and Sociocultural Studies, and Africana Studies as well as a Faculty Fellow in the Graduate College at the University of Arizona.
